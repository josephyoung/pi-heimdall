# pi-heimdall

Guardian extensions for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) that protect
against accidental secret exposure through tool calls.

Named after Heimdall, watcher of the Bifröst — the one who sees everything
coming and slams the gate shut when it shouldn't pass.

Ported from the equivalent [opencode](https://opencode.ai) plugins.

## What it does

pi-heimdall ships five independent extensions. Each one intercepts tool calls
before they run (and, in one case, after they return) and blocks or redacts
anything that would leak secrets to the LLM context.

| Extension | Tool | Blocks / redacts |
|---|---|---|
| `sandbox-guard` | `bash` | OS-level filesystem isolation via bubblewrap — only project dir + system binaries visible, synthetic `/etc`, env var stripping |
| `env-protect` | `read` | Reading `.env`, `.env.*`, `.envrc`, `*.env` — except `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, `.env.template`, `.env.dist`, `.env.defaults` |
| `kubectl-secret-guard` | `bash` | `kubectl get secrets`, `kubectl patch ... finalizers`, `kubectl exec` into a pod that dumps env / `/var/run/secrets` / `app.ini` |
| `sops-secret-guard` | `bash` | Any `sops` invocation that would decrypt content: `sops decrypt`, `sops -d`, `sops --decrypt`, `sops exec-env`, `sops exec-file`, `sops edit`, and bare `sops <file>` |
| `command-policy-guard` | `bash` | Commands that violate repo policy as defined in `.pi/heimdall.json` (e.g. blocking `cargo test` in favour of `mise test`) |
| `secret-guard` | `bash` | Commands that reference secret env var names from a project `.env.json`, and redacts their values from bash output (plaintext, base64, rot13, reversed, hex, and hexdump-decoded) |

All four are **independent** — enable whichever subset you need.

## Install

### Global (all projects)

```bash
pi install git:github.com/casualjim/pi-heimdall
```

### Project-local

```bash
pi install -l git:github.com/casualjim/pi-heimdall
```

Project-local installs land in `.pi/settings.json` and are picked up
automatically for every run in that directory.

### From a local clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/casualjim/pi-heimdall ~/src/pi-heimdall
pi install ~/src/pi-heimdall
```

### Drop into `.pi/extensions/` manually

Pi auto-discovers any `.ts` file in `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` (global) or
`.pi/extensions/` (project). You can copy or symlink individual files:

```bash
mkdir -p .pi/extensions
ln -s ~/src/pi-heimdall/extensions/secret-guard.ts .pi/extensions/
```

This is useful when you want only some of the guards active.

### Try without installing

```bash
pi -e git:github.com/casualjim/pi-heimdall
```

## Configuring `sandbox-guard`

`sandbox-guard` provides filesystem isolation for agent tools. Bash commands run inside a bubblewrap (bwrap) namespace, and built-in file tools (`read`, `write`, `edit`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`) are checked against the same path policy before execution. The agent cannot read `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config`, or any other files outside the configured sandbox paths.

**Requirements:** Linux with `bubblewrap` installed (`apt install bubblewrap`, `dnf install bubblewrap`, etc.).

Configuration lives in `.pi/heimdall.json`. The minimal config is:

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

Advanced config uses one `paths` object and one `env` object:

```json
{
  "sandbox": {
    "enabled": true,
    "network": "host",
    "paths": {
      "./src": { "mode": "write" },
      "/etc": [
        { "path": "/etc/resolv.conf" },
        { "path": "/etc/hosts" },
        {
          "path": "/etc/passwd",
          "content": "nobody:x:65534:65534:Nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin\n"
        }
      ]
    },
    "env": {
      "allow": null,
      "deny": ["*_TOKEN", "*_SECRET", "*_PASSWORD", "AWS_*", "GITHUB_TOKEN"]
    }
  }
}
```

Path rules:

- `paths` keys are prefixes.
- A value can be one entry or an array of entries.
- An entry without `path` applies to the whole prefix.
- An entry with `path` applies to that specific file/path under the prefix.
- `mode` defaults to `"read"`; write access requires `"mode": "write"`.
- `content` creates a synthetic file at `path` for sandboxed bash commands. Direct host `read` of synthetic paths is blocked so it cannot expose the real host file.

Default path visibility:

- Project directory `.` (read-write)
- `/tmp` (read-write)
- Read-only system prefixes when present: `/usr`, `/opt`, `/srv`, `/etc`, `/nix/store`, `/run/current-system/sw`
- Legacy/non-usr-merged compatibility prefixes when needed: `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/lib`, `/lib64`

Environment rules:

- `env.allow` omitted or `null` inherits the current environment.
- `env.allow: []` starts with no environment variables.
- `env.deny` removes matching variables and overrides `allow`.
- Exact names and `*` globs are supported.

**Network:** Shared with host by default (`"host"`). Use `"network": "none"` to isolate the network namespace.

**Disable for a session:** `pi --no-sandbox`

**Check status:** `/sandbox` command in the TUI

## Enabling / disabling individual guards

Use pi's package filter to narrow down which files load:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "git:github.com/casualjim/pi-heimdall",
      "extensions": [
        "extensions/env-protect.ts",
        "extensions/sops-secret-guard.ts"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Or use `pi config` interactively.

## Configuring `command-policy-guard`

`command-policy-guard` reads repo-specific command policies from `.pi/heimdall.json`
at the project root. If the file is missing, the guard does nothing.

Example `.pi/heimdall.json`:

```json
{
  "commandPolicies": [
    {
      "name": "no-cargo-test",
      "blocked": ["cargo", "test"],
      "message": "Use `mise test` or `mise run test` instead of `cargo test`."
    },
    {
      "name": "no-cargo-nextest",
      "blocked": ["cargo", "nextest"],
      "message": "Use `mise test` or `mise run --force test` instead of `cargo nextest`."
    }
  ]
}
```

Each policy has three fields:

- **`name`** — a human-readable identifier used in block messages.
- **`blocked`** — an array of tokens that must appear at the start of a command.
  Prefix matching is used, so `["cargo", "test"]` blocks `cargo test`,
  `cargo test --lib`, `cargo test foo::bar`, etc.
- **`message`** — the explanation shown to the model when a command is blocked.

The command line is properly tokenized (respecting single quotes, double quotes,
and backslash escapes) and each shell segment (commands separated by `;`, `|`,
`&&`, `||`, or newlines) is checked independently.

### Bypass hardening

The guard handles several patterns a motivated LLM might try:

- **Env prefixes**: `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp cargo test` — `KEY=value` tokens
  before the command are skipped.
- **Wrapper commands**: `sudo cargo test`, `env cargo test`, `eval cargo test` —
  known wrappers are skipped before matching.
- **Shell groups**: `{ cargo test; }`, `( cargo test )` — `{` and `(` prefix
  tokens are skipped.
- **Shell `-c` recursion**: `bash -c 'cargo test'` — the `-c` argument is
  recursively parsed through the full pipeline (segments, heredocs, policies).
- **Path-qualified commands**: `/usr/bin/cargo test`, `~/.cargo/bin/cargo test` —
  basename matching resolves `cargo` from any path.
- **Backslash escapes**: `car\go test` — escapes are consumed during
  tokenization so the result matches `cargo`.
- **Quote splicing**: `ca''rgo test`, `ca""rgo test` — empty quotes are
  stripped during tokenization.
- **Heredocs**: `cat <<EOF\ncargo test\nEOF` — heredoc bodies are excluded
  from matching to avoid false positives.

### Known acceptable gaps

Some patterns cannot be caught without a full shell interpreter:

- `timeout 60 cargo test` — wrappers that take arguments before the command
- `docker run cargo test`, `ssh host cargo test` — indirect execution
- `python3 -c "os.system('cargo test')"` — embedded language execution
- `nix develop -c cargo test` — tool-specific wrappers

## Configuring `secret-guard`

`secret-guard` is the other guard that needs configuration. Create a `.env.json`
at your project root listing the environment variables that should be treated
as secrets. **Values in the JSON are ignored — only the keys matter.** The
actual secret values are captured from `process.env` when pi starts.

```json
{
  "GITHUB_TOKEN": "",
  "OPENAI_API_KEY": "",
  "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY": "",
  "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": ""
}
```

With this in place:

- Any bash command that mentions `GITHUB_TOKEN` as a whole word is blocked.
- Any bash output containing the actual value of `GITHUB_TOKEN` (in plaintext,
  base64, rot13, reversed, raw hex, or hexdump form) is replaced with
  `[REDACTED]`.

Even without `.env.json`, `secret-guard` still applies a generic
trailing-pattern redaction: anything matching `*(SECRET|KEY|TOKEN|PASSWORD|PASS|APIKEY|CREDENTIAL|PRIVATE)=...`
in bash output gets its value masked.

### A `sops` key is ignored

If your `.env.json` uses the key `sops` (for example, it's a sops-encrypted
file with a `sops` metadata section), that key is skipped so pi-heimdall
doesn't try to match literal metadata as a secret name.

## How the guards communicate with the LLM

When a guard blocks a tool call it returns a `reason` string that is delivered
back to the model as the tool result. Every reason includes an explicit
instruction such as:

> *Ask the user to run this command directly in their terminal if needed.
> Never attempt to bypass this protection or ask the user to disable it.*

This keeps the model from going into "creative workaround" mode and trying a
different command to accomplish the same leak.

If a pi TUI is attached, a warning notification is also shown so you can see
the block in real time.

## Layout

```
extensions/
├── command-policy-guard.ts
├── env-protect.ts
├── kubectl-secret-guard.ts
├── secret-guard.ts
└── sops-secret-guard.ts
```

Each file is a standalone extension. There is no shared runtime state between
them — you can delete any file and the others will keep working.

## Development

```bash
npm install           # optional: only for editor tooling / type checks
npm run typecheck     # type-check the extensions
npm run check:pack    # verify the package tarball contents
```

GitHub Actions runs the same checks on pushes and pull requests to `main`.

Pi loads `.ts` files directly via [jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti), so no
build step is required at runtime.
